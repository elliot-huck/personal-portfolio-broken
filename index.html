	<p>Dear Internet User,</p>
	<p>This site is temporarily unavailable because, while attempting to redesign it, my reach exceeded my grasp and the site's form became truly hideous to behold. Unfortunately, I had committed unspeakable horrors to the poor git repository, and I am still trying to straighten everything out.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, perhaps you'd like to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliot-huck">visit my LinkedIn profile</a> instead?</p>
	<p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
	<p>Elliot Huck</p>
